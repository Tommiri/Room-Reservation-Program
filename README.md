# Room reservation program

This was the final project for our C++ Basics course at school. In total the programming took me roughly 15 hours and I'm pleased with my work. I recieved full marks for the project and the whole course.

## Functionality

* Enter your details to book either a single or a double room
* The program will generate a unique reservation number for you
* After creating your reservation you can search for it by either name or reservation number
* If a reservation is found, you can view and edit any detail of it and the program will save the changes
* You can cancel your reservation and the program will erase it from memory

## Room for improvement
As with all of my projects so far, the project lacks modularization. All of the code is in one file which is far from ideal. Learning modular coding is on the top of my to-do list.

## Additional features

In addition to the given requirements for features in the assignment, my program has:  

- The possibility to search for reservations using either reservation number or name  
- The possibility to edit everything in your reservation with updating prices  
- A well functioning and user friendly interface with plenty of checks for edge cases and solutions for them
